    primitive/immutable
    1.strings  - "",'',``
    2.numbers  - integers
    3.bool	   - true/false

    non-primitive/mutable
    4.array		- array is collection of elements (element can be any datatype)
    5.obj		- collection of properties (each property is key value pair , key will be string,value any datatype)

React 

Class component
    Syntax 
        class ClassName extends React.Component{

        }
    Props 
        this.props
        - plain js object,used to send data from parent child
        - props are immutable that cant be changed in child component
    
    State 
        this.state
        this.setState - (object,callback)
        -  state is plain Javascript object.That can be access using this.state
        - state can be updated using setState method
            - plain object
            - call back

Function Compmonent
    Hooks
        useState used to create state in Function component
    Props 
        - Compmonent Name must be pascal case 
        - it should always rfeturn jsx
        - can access using props parameter 
        - plain js object,used to send data from parent components to child components
        - props are immutable that cant be changed in child component
    State
        - any data type of js,that used to store data internally in component
        - the state can be changed internally in the component
        - A component can have multiple states
        - state can be any datatype of Javascript
    
    Life cycle methods in react component
        these are methods called by react based on component stage
        componentDidMount
            Called immediately after a component is mounted. Setting state here will trigger re-rendering.
        shouldComponentUpdate
            Called to determine whether the change in props and state should trigger a re-render.
            Component always returns true. PureComponent implements a shallow comparison on props and state and 
            returns true if any props or states have changed.If false is returned, Component#render, 
            componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate will not be called.
        componentDidUpdate
            Called immediately after updating occurs. Not called for the initial render.
            The snapshot is only present if getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is present and returns non-null.
        componentWillUnmount
            Called immediately before a component is destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, 
            such as cancelled network requests, or cleaning up any DOM elements created in componentDidMount.

    
    Conditional Rendering
        - used to remove elements or add react elements dynamically

    Rendering List
        - it is the way of Rendering multiple elements
        
        - create an arr with strings,numbers,object and render this arr using map

        - create an arr from state with strings,numbers,object and render this arr using map

        - create an arr from state with strings,numbers,object and render this arr using map and update state
    
    life cycle hooks
        useEfeecet
    diff between class component and function component :
    
    






Events
    - We can add event on react elements. click,hover,drag  etc...
